There are 4 files in this script...

There are edits necessary to make them
work correctly in your environment.

Edit sgkeys.cfg to contain the correct
information for your set-up. This will
include URL's, shotgun script keys and
the name of the script created in the
shotgun admin interface

After that is edited you should be able
to run the
setup_actionmenu_create_playlist.py
script to create the actionmenu. This
script was tested on python 2.6. It
returns the id of the menu_item in case
you ever need to delete it. To run it
you will have to have the shotgun API in
your python path

the other two scripts and the config
file should reside on your seb server
along-side a copy of the python API.

You should not have to edit either of
the scripts but if you want to fancy up
the HTML, add CSS, etc. you are welcome
to do so.

These have been tested with Python 2.4
